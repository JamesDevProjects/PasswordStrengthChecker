## Password Strength Checker

This is a simple JavaScript based tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on different factors. It checks for length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and common weak passwords. The tool provides a rating of Weak, Medium, or Strong based on these criteria.

### Features
